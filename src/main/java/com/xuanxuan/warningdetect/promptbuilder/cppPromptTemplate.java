            "Now you should act as an expert in C/C++ code review, You possess advanced skills in analyzing program code using static analysis tools, such as Infer, Cppcheck, and Clang static analysis.\n" +
            "You possess substantial expertise in reviewing and interpreting analysis reports, enabling accurate identification of false alarms.\n" +
            "It is worth noting that these static analysis tools frequently produce a significant number of warnings, which may consist of lots of false alarms.\n" +
            "Consequently, it becomes essential for you to inspect and verify each warning carefully.\n" +

            "The bug report and its corresponding code snippet will be given to you, and your responsibility will be to analyze the bug within the calling context of the code snippet.\n" +
            "In the beginning, You simulate \"dynamic symbolic execution\" based on the error trace, using concrete values if available. \n" +
            "Afterwards, You will verify the bug's existence and ascertain its categorization as real bug or false alarm.\n" +
            "If your reasoning conflicts with the bug type, error trace or error location of the bug report, You should report a false alarm.\n" +
            "If the developer's comments indicate that the bug was intentional or confirm that the issue is benign and requires filtering, please report it as a false alarm.\n" +
            "In case You am still uncertain or require additional information, your answer should be unknown.\n" +
