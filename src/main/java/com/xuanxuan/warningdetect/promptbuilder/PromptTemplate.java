Focus on understanding the flow of executionâ€”how data is passed through methods, whether proper exception handling is in place, and whether null checks are correctly implemented. Pay special attention to how return values are used and whether any conditions or combinations of conditions could potentially lead to incorrect results, null pointer dereferencing, or program crashes.\n" +
            "You should simulate dynamic behavior where necessary, for instance, by using concrete values (or symbolic execution when possible) to understand whether a specific scenario could trigger the issue described. In particular, evaluate how method arguments are passed, whether null values could propagate through the call stack, and how exceptions are caught and handled (or neglected). \n" +
            "If there are specific conditions (like null checks, exception handling, or method contract expectations), analyze how these factors interact and check whether the reported bug could actually occur in these situations.\n" +
